# Application guide

The public package supplies stable fermionic-kernel evaluation, deterministic
finite-grid GECP, solve-based cross approximation, diagonal-pivoted Cholesky,
conditional Lipschitz pivot certificates, numerical separated interpolation,
and sparse spectral recovery.

```python
import numpy as np

from kernelgecp import FermionicKernel, GECPConfig, gecp, evaluate_residual

kernel = FermionicKernel(cutoff=100)
result = gecp(
    kernel,
    config=GECPConfig(pivot="grid", tol=1e-10, precision_bits=128),
)
residual = evaluate_residual(
    kernel,
    result,
    np.linspace(0, 1, 101),
    np.linspace(-100, 100, 401),
)
print(result.rank, result.converged, result.stop_reason, abs(residual).max())
```

`cross_approximation` solves with the selected core; it never forms an explicit
inverse. Results include residual history, determinants, smallest singular
values, near-tie counts, convergence, stop reason, and actual precision.
Runs above 53 bits retain canonical decimal strings in `result.high_precision`;
the NumPy compatibility views remain float64.
For PSD matrices, `pivoted_cholesky` and `gecp_matrix` use the same
diagonal-preferring lexicographic tie rule; the recursive equivalence of those
pivot policies is separately proved in Lean.

## Certified pivots

`certified_pivot` performs deterministic float64 cell subdivision from a
supplied coordinatewise Lipschitz bound. Its result is conditional on that
analytic bound. `interval_certified_pivot` instead uses `mpmath` interval
arithmetic, outward-rounded float endpoints, and an optional interval-gradient
mean-value enclosure.

`gecp(FermionicKernel(...), config=GECPConfig(pivot="adaptive", ...))` applies
the interval method to every continuous residual pivot and retains each
successful `PivotCertificate`. Cell-budget exhaustion returns
`stop_reason="uncertified_pivot"`; it never silently becomes convergence.
These certificates audit numerical pivot quality. The Lean derivative theorems
prove the underlying kernel formulas and domain bounds, but Python execution is
not itself a formal proof of a continuous GECP rate.

## Separated interpolation

`fermionic_separated_approximation` uses piecewise barycentric interpolation on
dyadic Chebyshev frequency bands. `dlr_rank_bound` and
`exp_family_rank_bound` report explicit arithmetic counts for research
comparison.

`fermionic_dyadic_taylor_approximation` is the independent high-precision
implementation of the Lean-verified construction. For cutoff `Λ`, it chooses
`s = ceil(log₂ Λ)` and `p = ceil(log₂(1/tolerance))`; its public `rank` is
`16p(s+1)` and `error_bound` is `2⁻ᵖ`.

```python
from kernelgecp import fermionic_dyadic_taylor_approximation

approximation = fermionic_dyadic_taylor_approximation(1e6, 1e-8)
values = approximation.evaluate([0.0, 0.5, 1.0], [1e6, 0.0, -1e6])
print(approximation.rank, approximation.error_bound, values)
```

This constructive bound certifies low-rank existence. It does not certify a
GECP convergence rate.

## Sparse spectral recovery

`sparse_representation` performs orthogonal matching pursuit and optional
bounded nonlinear frequency refinement. It returns `converged=False` when the
requested tolerance is not met. The fixed two-delta regression reaches
`1e-8` with two atoms. AAA and vector fitting are deferred extension methods,
not placeholder APIs.

## Realistic synthetic application suite

`run_synthetic_application_suite` connects the public algorithms in three
workloads: continuous fermionic spectral compression, clean/noisy sparse
spectral recovery, and PSD covariance landmark selection.

```python
from kernelgecp import (
    SyntheticApplicationConfig,
    run_synthetic_application_suite,
)

suite = run_synthetic_application_suite(
    SyntheticApplicationConfig(),
    git_commit="local",
)

for record in suite.green_compression:
    print(
        record.fixture,
        record.gecp_rank,
        record.green_validation_error,
        record.transfer_bound,
    )

for record in suite.sparse_recovery:
    print(
        record.fixture,
        record.candidate_strategy,
        record.recovered_atom_count,
        record.held_out_error,
        record.stop_reason,
    )

print(
    suite.psd_landmarks.selected_rank,
    suite.psd_landmarks.pivot_paths_agree,
    suite.psd_landmarks.cross_max_error,
)
```

The two continuous densities are normalized on `[-8,8]` and share one
12-pivot, 128-bit fermionic GECP basis. `GreenCompressionResult` reports the
held-out kernel and Green errors, the discrete `L¹` transfer bound, selected-
core conditioning, and both the observed and theorem-matched ranks. The
Hubbard-like and gapped fixtures reach Green errors `4.16e-10` and `2.91e-10`,
respectively, below the common `5.40e-9` transfer bound.

The sparse results deliberately name their candidate strategy. The clean
quasiparticle/satellite fixture uses a four-entry known transition library and
recovers it to `3.33e-16` held-out error. The noisy fixture performs a blind
scan over 1,604 frequencies; its eight effective atoms reproduce the
underlying noiseless Green function to `8.56e-9`. The latter is a compact
function representation, not evidence that the four generating frequencies
were uniquely recovered.

The PSD fixture generates 72 clustered synthetic sensor locations and a
smooth Gaussian covariance. Complete-pivot GECP and diagonal-pivoted Cholesky
choose the same 31 landmarks. The solve-based selected cross has maximum error
`7.78e-7` and relative Frobenius error `1.14e-7`.

All fixtures are synthetic. They are motivated by DLR Green-function
compression, correlated spectral functions, noisy imaginary-time inversion,
and covariance landmark selection, but they are not material-specific fits,
uncertainty-quantified analytic continuation, or optimal sensor-placement
claims.

## Reproducible experiments

```bash
uv run python -m kernelgecp.census \
  --config experiments/census.toml \
  --output experiments/data/gecp_census.jsonl
uv run python experiments/exact_surrogates.py
uv run python experiments/synthetic_applications.py \
  --config experiments/synthetic_applications.toml \
  --output experiments/data/synthetic_applications.json \
  --plot experiments/data/synthetic_applications.png
```

Runtime algorithms require no network access. The canonical census evaluates
endpoint-refined grids at 128-bit precision and records decimal strings. Its
three tolerance records per cutoff are exact prefixes of one strict trajectory;
the checked dataset is byte-reproducible. Adaptive interval certification is a
separate, more expensive continuous-domain mode.

For the open GECP-rate question, `analyze_census_file` computes
cutoff-normalized block ratios from the stored decimal strings, while
`certify_fermionic_block_contraction` uses outward-rounded interval residuals
along a returned approximate-pivot trajectory:

```python
from pathlib import Path

from kernelgecp import (
    analyze_census_file,
    certify_fermionic_block_contraction,
)

blocks = analyze_census_file(Path("experiments/data/gecp_census.jsonl"))
cutoff_one = certify_fermionic_block_contraction(1.0, 2)
assert cutoff_one.half_contraction_certified
```

`BlockContractionEvidence.continuous_certified` is always false because the
canonical census is finite-grid evidence. A certified block result applies to
the explicitly returned interval-certified approximate-pivot trajectory; it
does not establish a cutoff-uniform exact-GECP theorem or resolve arbitrary
tie choices.

The synthetic-application JSON excludes timestamps, records the implementation
Git commit and configuration hash, and is byte-identical across repeated runs.
The PNG is a human-facing summary and is not used as the source of numerical
truth.

## Release provenance

The implementation agent's exposed model family and mode, goal-accounting
time and token snapshot, and the assumptions behind the API-equivalent cost
estimate are documented in
[FINAL_HANDOFF.md](FINAL_HANDOFF.md#implementation-run-metadata). They describe
the v1 implementation run, not package runtime requirements or benchmark
performance.
