# Research contracts

## Phase 0 — bootstrap

State: complete; merged in [PR #1](https://github.com/tripp-smith/gecp-kernel-structure/pull/1).

Deliverables are the repository-scoped skills, pinned Lean and Python
toolchains, package roots, verification scripts, CI, and progress metadata.
This phase makes no mathematical claim.

## Milestone A — exact selected core closure

State: complete; merged in [PR #4](https://github.com/tripp-smith/gecp-kernel-structure/pull/4).

The phase closes the remaining gap between the dependent `GECP.Run` object and
the determinant/nonsingularity API. The exact public contract is:

- `Run.SelectedIndex` enumerates the successful pivots in their run order;
- `Run.selectedCore` evaluates the original kernel at those selected rows and
  columns;
- `Run.finSelectedCore` reindexes that same matrix by `Fin run.pivots.length`;
- `gecp_core_det_eq_prod_pivots` proves that the determinant of the finite
  selected core is the ordered product of the actual residual pivots carried
  by `run`;
- `gecp_core_nonsingular` proves the selected core determinant is nonzero.

The proof must derive its block elimination step from `residualUpdate` and the
nonzero pivot witness already stored in `Run.step`. It may not assume external
LDU data. This phase does not add a GECP convergence or pivot-selection claim.

## Milestone B — recursive PSD/Cholesky equivalence

State: complete; merged in [PR #5](https://github.com/tripp-smith/gecp-kernel-structure/pull/5).

The phase strengthens the existing one-step diagonal-domination result to the
following exact contract for finite real PSD matrices:

- `diagonalResidual` is the symmetric same-domain Schur update at a positive
  diagonal pivot;
- `posDef_gecp_residual_posSemidefinite` proves that update remains PSD;
- `IsDiagonalPivot` and `IsCompletePivot` state the pivoted-Cholesky and GECP
  maximizer predicates;
- `PivotedCholeskyTrace` and `GECPTrace` record the same ordered residual
  updates with their respective pivot predicates;
- `gecp_eq_pivotedCholesky_of_posDef` proves the two recursive trace relations
  equivalent for every pivot list.

The complete-pivot relation deliberately uses a diagonal pivot location and
the repository's diagonal-preferring canonical tie policy. The theorem does
not claim that every arbitrary off-diagonal tie choice produces the same run,
and it does not claim the stronger published Lipschitz convergence rate.

## Milestone C — high-precision census and certified pivot closure

State: complete; merged in [PR #6](https://github.com/tripp-smith/gecp-kernel-structure/pull/6).

This closure phase delivers:

- a genuine `mpmath` finite-grid GECP backend that executes at
  `GECPConfig.precision_bits` and preserves canonical quantities as decimal
  strings;
- an outward-rounded interval branch-and-bound pivot certificate for the
  fermionic residual on the continuous rectangle;
- adaptive GECP results that retain every pivot certificate and never report
  certification after a cell-budget exhaustion;
- a canonical endpoint-resolved finite-grid census whose recorded 128-bit
  precision and grid algorithm match the backend actually used, with
  repeat-run byte equality;
- the kernel derivative bounds and grid-to-continuous theorem/API constants
  needed to interpret approximate pivots.

The canonical census uses finite grids because a complete continuous adaptive
census is substantially more expensive. The supported adaptive mode retains
interval certificates and reports budget exhaustion honestly. Neither the
census nor those certificates are substituted for Lean proofs of the
Milestone D or E rate theorems.

## Milestone D — constructive separated approximation

State: verified on `codex/phase-d-separated-approx`; awaiting phase PR delivery.

Delivered:

- `expNegTaylor_error_le_next` proves the exact Lagrange remainder for the
  truncated negative exponential;
- `pow_div_factorial_eight_mul_le` proves that `8p` terms give error at most
  `2⁻ᵖ` whenever the local product is at most `2p`;
- `expFamily_separatedApprox` constructs `8p(s+1)` separated terms and proves
  uniform error `2⁻ᵖ` on `[0,1] × [0,2ˢ]`;
- `fermionicKernel_separatedApprox` uses the exact reflection identity and the
  positive denominator to construct `16p(s+1)` terms with the same uniform
  error on `[0,1] × [-2ˢ,2ˢ]`;
- `fermionic_dyadic_taylor_approximation` independently implements the same
  band/time-cutoff rules at arbitrary precision and tests band boundaries and
  cutoff `10⁶`.

The primary formal construction is a dyadic truncated-Taylor construction,
not the selected-exponential Chebyshev construction in Gimbutas–Marshall–
Rokhlin. It proves the same required `O(log Λ log(1/ε))` separated-rank scale
with conservative constants and has a substantially smaller formal
interpolation dependency surface. The published selected-exponential variant
remains a possible strengthening, not a prerequisite for the delivered
low-rank theorem. Nothing in this milestone proves that GECP selects these
terms or converges at this rate.

## Milestone E — structural GECP

State: blocked (research).

Exact checks completed for all requested geometric surrogates. There were no
zero minors and no sign mismatches. However, the exact pivot sequences depend
on `q`; for size eight the three requested ratios produce different row and
column orders. This is a certified obstruction to the proposed invariant
“GECP has one parameter-independent ordered pivot path.” It is not yet the
stronger SPEC-approved obstruction/refined sufficient condition needed to
close Milestone E.

The endpoint-resolved 128-bit finite-grid census exhibits rank growth across
all seven cutoffs, but remains numerical evidence rather than a continuous
rate theorem. The next theorem contract is:

1. formalize sign regularity for geometric/exponential collocation minors;
2. state a quantitative cross-ratio hypothesis on Schur residuals;
3. prove that hypothesis implies an explicit near-max-volume comparison;
4. test whether the fermionic residual satisfies the hypothesis using
   outward-rounded or exact bounds.

Milestone E may close only with one rigorous outcome allowed by `SPEC.md`: the
target rate, a weaker improved rate, a structural-class theorem containing the
fermionic kernel, or a certified obstruction with a refined sufficient
condition. Experiments alone cannot close the milestone.
